# CatImageClassifier-DeepNeuralNetwork
## A cat vs non-cat image classifier built by self imlementing Deep Neural Network algorithms in Python.  
### This project was a part of the Deep Learning and Neural Networks course from DeepLearning.ai Specialization Coursera.
Implemented forward and backward propagation algorithms in Python using matrix operations and then used them to build a cat vs non-cat image classifier .
#### Test Set Accuracy - 82%
